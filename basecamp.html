						<h1>Hello Basecamp</h1>
						<p>I’m Camilo Oliveira, a product designer from São Paulo (2 hours ahead of Chicago time).</p>

							<h3>You are hiring a product designer</h3>
							<p>And I would love to join this challenge to help grow and expand Basecamp and HEY.</p>
							<p>I loved HEY from the start. The opportunity to help evolve such a sexy product is something I don’t want to miss.</p>

							<h3>Why Camilo?</h3>
							<p>I always had to learn a bunch of things to do my work. From HTML, CSS a bit of Javascript and jQuery to banner ads (RIP Flash) and also user experience and interface design. I also care about proper copywriting, that should tell clear messages to users and avoid ambiguous words.</p>

							<p>Most of the time I like to hear people speak, tell their stories and opinions. It’s an opportunity to learn and helps a lot when designing products for others, be they colleagues or end-users.</p>

							<h3>1) Yellow Collectors</h3>
							<p>Yellow was a scooter and bike startup that had operations in many cities in Brazil. I joined them in the first month of operations as their first product designer.</p>

							<p>Everything started with bikes and then scooters. A few months later, to escalate the scooter operation and increase inventory on the streets from ~300 to 1000+, the company needed a proof-of-concept that working with 3rd parties was viable in big Brazilian cities like São Paulo.</p>

						<div class="copy">
							<p>These people should collect the scooters with a low battery after 9 PM and take it to our warehouses.</p>
							<p>Later was added the option to deploy charged scooters to appropriate spots early in the morning.</p>

							<p>I designed the app screens, interactions, and proper instructions to get the work done.</p>
							<p>It worked and then was rolled out to cities like Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Campinas, among others.</p>

							<h3>2) Yellow Guardians</h3>

							<p>After adding e-scooters, the job of the internal team changed and they needed new features to take care of new electric vehicles.</p>

							<p>I visited the warehouses to better understand their job and designed new flows to turn scooters on and off, help them signal that any scooter was in-house, and start checklists, which were their main task.</p>

							<h3>3) Rabbot Flow</h3>

							<p>Rabbot helps companies manage their fleets by digitizing and automating operations through its Saas platform and mobile app.</p>

							<p>The most important part of the platform is the Flow page, which allows users to see what is happening with their vehicles.</p>

							<p>I worked with the team to create new features, power up existing ones, and evolve its interface design that is being expanded to the entire product.</p>
